# Repo Radar

A personalized GitHub repository momentum dashboard that tracks star growth, releases, and issue activity across your starred repositories.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This project uses an intentional directory structure inspired by [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), separating application code from project documentation:

```
repo-radar/
├── app/                 # Main application (React/TypeScript/Vite)
├── specs/              # Project specifications and planning
├── docs/               # Documentation (future)
├── guides/             # User guides and tutorials (future)
└── README.md           # This file
```

This structure provides clear separation between executable code and documentation, allowing the project to scale with additional documentation folders without cluttering the application directory.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

For detailed application documentation, see [app/README.md](./app/README.md).
